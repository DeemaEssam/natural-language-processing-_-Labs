# Introduction-to-Topic-Modeling

Topic models uncover hidden structure in a collection of texts. 
we then evaluate the model to determine how well the model performs on unseen data, ensuring it generalizes beyond the training set.

Evaluation Methods:

Eye Balling Models: Manual inspection of top words and topics.

Intrinsic Metrics: Measures like topic coherence, which assess the semantic similarity of words within a topic.

Human Judgments: Involves subjective evaluations of what constitutes a topic.

Extrinsic Metrics: Evaluating how well a model performs on specific tasks.
